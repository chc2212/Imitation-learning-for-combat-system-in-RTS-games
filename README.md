#Features
*	A combat system for RTS games by imitating human players’ micromanagement skills based on spatial analysis. 
*	Case-based reasoning approach to design the system.
*	Influence map representation to analyze the influence of units spatially and to allow for high-speed case comparison.
*	Showed that the proposed approach outperforms competitive entries in StarCraft competitions for combat situations.
